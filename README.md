# studentmanagement
Simple studentmanagement program using JAVA and its GUI without the database language.

It has two different parts: manager and students. 

Features of manager:

It can add students to access to the system, and find students info by their unique id. Also, if the student add courses, it appears in the queue and manager can confim the courses that student have. 

It can add, remove, or modify the courses that students can take.


Features of Students:

Since the password and id are given by the manager, it can change its password, but not its id. Students can modify its personal information. Also they can search and add courses. 


Searching Courses:
This feature is included in both manager and student. If user press search by only inputting the category, then all courses under that category appears. If user search with specific id and category, it searches only that course.


Since the database is not used, all created object is freed when the program stop running.
